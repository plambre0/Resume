**Projects**

Estimating Causal Effects of Lead Exposure on Kidney Related Death (2025-Present) \[R\]

Conducted a causal mediation analysis using the 2005–2006 NHANES linked to 2025 mortality outcomes to evaluate whether kidney dysfunction (measured through eGFR) mediates a relationship between blood lead levels and future mortality. Implemented survey-weighted interventional mediation analysis with multiple imputations for non-MCAR missing data. Estimated total, direct, and indirect effects using doubly robust estimation while adjusting for confounders specified through a DAG.

Negative Effects of Penicillamine in Cirrhosis Accounting for Competing Risks (2025-Present) \[R\]

Reanalyzed the Dickson et al. PBC cohort using competing risks methods to account for the potential for liver transplants as an informative competing event. Estimated treatment effects through Fine–Gray sub distribution hazard models and compared results to standard Cox models to evaluate bias under standard survival model assumptions.

Forecasting Leqembi Adoption (2025) \[R\]

Forecasted US utilization of Leqembi through end of the decade considering Medicare coverage expansion. Incorporated eligibility prevalence, amyloid plaque presence, and reimbursement assumptions to project adoption curves through bass diffusion models and potential budget impact. Conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate how policy changes may affect projected utilization.
