Statisticians Without Borders

**Experience**

*Bioinformatics Researcher, DePaul Applied and Computational Bioinformatics Lab*

January 2025 – Present

* Conducted literature review to design statistical workflows for single-cell spatial transcriptomics analysis.  
* Investigated spatial relationships between gene expression and neuroanatomical structure in the brainstem using imaging analysis and spatial statistics.  
* Developed scalable Python and R pipelines using Git to streamline gene expression and imaging analysis.  
* Applied PCA, multidimensional scaling, t-SNE, and UMAP for high-dimensional data exploration and visualization.  
* Identified region-specific gene expression patterns using point pattern analysis, cluster detection, and spatially varying gene identification methods.  
* Co-authored paper accepted to ICBCB 2026; presented findings at university research symposium.

*Statistical Epidemiology Researcher, Khomtchouk Lab, Indiana University Luddy School of Informatics*

March 2025 – October 2025

* Designed and analyzed epidemiologic studies involving high-dimensional and incomplete survey, genomic, and longitudinal data.  
* Implemented multiple imputation and pattern-mixture models to address missing data under high uncertainty.  
* Estimated causal effects of risk factors on disease progression using DAG-based modeling, structural equation models, and Bayesian inference.  
* Performed meta-analysis and stochastic simulation to synthesize literature-derived parameter estimates for risk modeling.  
* Delivered technical reports and presentations under strict research timelines.
